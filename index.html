					<p>Hi, welcome to my website, below I outline the purpose of it, what it contains, the aims of it and what technology was used in its creation, in essence it's based around my amateur photography, a sample of which you can see below:</p>

				<h2>Purpose:</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this website is to show some of the front-end skills I have been developing through the Full Stack Web Development course run by the Code Institute. It has the dual purpose of covering the examination requirements while also showing prospective employers what I am capable of.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
				<h2>Content:</h2>
				<p>The main content is on the media page is based around a hobby of mine, which is landscape photography. It’s a very amateur level (as its only iPhone photos!) but hopefully some nice pictures none the less. There is a basic bio of my career and academic achievements in the profile page and a dummy contact me form in the contact page. The form will validate input to a reasonable degree, but it currently won’t send the information anywhere, so please don’t try to contact me though it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
				<h2>Aim:</h2>
				<p>	My main aim has been to try and make the site as scaleable as possible. I wanted the site to look good and be useable through all possible viewing devices. Whilst there has only been a short time scale for me to complete this site (as I wish to progress with the rest of the course) I feel that I have achived that main aim. I also wanted to implement some pure JavaScript into site and have achieved that the the picture viewer, plus I wanted this site to be user friendly and believe that I have achieved that by implementing defensive programming in both the picture viewer and form input.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
				<h2>Technology Used</h2>
				<p>For layout I have used bootstrap, although it is not working as default on this site, because I have deliberately overwritten some of the default settings to enable better scalability, an example of that is the scaling of text to suit the device being used. Also, while bootstrap also has default plug-ins/code, I wanted to illustrate some programming skills and as such did not use the bootstrap carousel, I created my own initially based on one from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp">w3schools</a>, but have heavily adapted it, as can be seen from the source JavaScript.</p>
