				<h2>MSc Systems Thinking & Practice (Merit)</h2>
				<img class="logoOnProfilePage" src="img/Logos/OULogo.jpg" alt="Lloyds Bank Logo">  
				<p>From the OU Website: <span class="OUWebsiteText">This MSc course explores the way we think about and approach tasks or situations. Everyone brings with them their own perspective, which means that we all see things in different ways. The discipline of systems thinking in practice will provide you with the tools to challenge your approach to complex situations, consider the roles other people play, and assess how different components within those situations are related. You will also develop the skills needed to think more holistically and work more collaboratively to avoid systemic failures.</span></p>
