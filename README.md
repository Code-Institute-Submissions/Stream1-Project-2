# Code Institute Stream 1 Project

## Overview

	I have deliberatly not used some bootstrap functionality, such as carousel as I wanted to set myself a JS challange of producing my own.


### What is this app for?
This website is to show some of the front-end skills I have been developing through the Full Stack Web Development course run by the Code Institute. It has the dual purpose of covering the examination requirements while also showing prospective employers what I am capable of.

### What does it do?



### How does it work
- Uses a bootstrap responsive menu (based on solution from Code Institute)
	- Text (including Brand/Menu Headings and form headings has been made response to different viewports/devices
	- Pictures being removed for smaller devices

- Maybe uses Model image model viewer from W3C, how been adpated?
